The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The essence stays invisibly below.<br>Master Yuan-Ma, The Book of Programming

        <h1>About Myself</h1>
        <p>This detailed landing page describes that I'm a current student at Moringa School, with no active job experience in software development. I have always been fascinated with coding and the way code can be manipulated. It's been a lifelong dream to actually wake up and be fluently versed in code. I enjoy biking, I love spending time with my friends, I am skilled in boxing and I am a huge fan of spanish music. I love animal and interacting with people. I was taught the importance of social economics by my mom. I still implement her lessons today. <br> I became passionate about coding when i was very young. I wrote my first RAT virus when I was 15. I studied my primary in a remote county called Kirinyaga, so you wouldn't expect the school to be diverse in tech-related studies. But that wasn't the case. I really disliked my computer teacher so I decided to create a virus that prompted the user for a set of values and text. I was the only one who knew the password and I have to say that it was fun to mess with my teacher.<br>
        My passion never faded since most of the things I know are self-taught. I enjoy biking, I love spending time with my friends, I am skilled in boxing and I am a huge fan of spanish music.
