# super-spork-landing-page
this is a detailed landing page describing 
I'm a current student at Moringa School with no active job experience in software development.
I have always been facinated with coding and the way code can be manipulated. It's been a lifelong dream to actually wake up and be fluently versed in code.
I enjoy biking, I love spending time with my friends, I am skilled in boxing and I am a huge fan of spanish music.
